# Subzero Signals-Analyzing IceCube Neutrinos
This project endeavors to harness the potential of big data analytics in the realm of neutrino research through a comprehensive exploration of the ”IceCube” dataset. The primary objectives include performing feature engineering to enhance data quality and utility, and evaluating the performance of various frameworks tailored to handling neutrino data. Additionally, the project aims to establish a robust key-value database and a fast querying system to facilitate efficient data retrieval and analysis.

Utilizing advanced clustering techniques, the project seeks to unravel patterns within positional data, enabling the grouping of neutrino events in deep space. Interactive data visualizations will be developed to facilitate in-depth analysis and outlier detection, empowering researchers with actionable insights.

Furthermore, the project will introduce a vector database specifically tailored for angular values, enabling streamlined vector queries. Demonstrating real-time processing capabilities, simulated data streaming will be implemented, showcasing the system’s capacity for live data processing. In a bid to enhance predictive capabilities, regression models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) will be trained on the dataset to predict the point of origin for neutrino events. Ultimately, this project aims to culminate in a multi-faceted, integrated system designed to optimally query, process, visualize, and deploy predictive models
on large-scale neutrino data.
